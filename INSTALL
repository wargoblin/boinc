To build the BOINC client software:
    ./_autosetup
    ./configure --disable-server

When building application that should run on BOINC, you no longer need to care about building BOINC libraries for every platform.
you can build and install BOINC libraries using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg install boinc

The BOINC port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.

To build the BOINC server components use the normal configure and make steps
without `--disable-server`:

    ./_autosetup
    ./configure
    make

More detailed information about setting up a server can be found on the
BOINC wiki (<https://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/ServerIntro>).

If you prefer downloading the dependencies yourself instead of using vcpkg,
have a look at the helper scripts in the `3rdParty` directory.  They fetch and
build the required libraries on Linux and macOS:

    ./3rdParty/buildLinuxDependencies.sh
    ./3rdParty/buildMacDependencies.sh
